# Cellular Automata

A simple study of emergent behaviour using cellular automata. Operates on the basic 3/2 rule.
The code is also segmented into header and .cpp files instead of everything being in the main.cpp

integrated basic pause and reset functionality

P - pause

S - clear screen and respawn CA with a randomised seed



the CA is white by default, colors can also bechanged using keyboard inputs, as follows:

R - red

G - green

B - blue

M - magenta

Y - yellow

C - cyan

X - randomised colors

(the colors can't be toggled for some reason, they'll appear the respective color as long as the key is held down but will default back to white when released)
