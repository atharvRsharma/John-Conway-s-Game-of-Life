# Cellular Automata

A simple study of emergent behavious using cellular automata. Operates on the basic 3/2 rule.

integrated a basic pause and reset functionality

P - pause

S - clear screen and respawn CA with a randomised seed

the CA is white by default, colors can also bechanged using keyboard inputs, as follows:

R - red

G - green

B - blue

M - magenta

Y - yellow

C - cyan

X - randomised colors

(the colors can't be toggled for some reason, they'll appear the respective color as long as the key is held down but will default back to white when released)
